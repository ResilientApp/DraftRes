# DraftRes
DraftRes is a Draft Fantasy Soccer that uses ResilientDB for storing and retrieving data. DraftRes' draft room offers a unique and engaging team selection experience. Accessed with valid credentials, teams follow a serpentine draft sequence (A-B-C-D-D-C-B-A) ensuring a balanced and dynamic selection process. Selections are broadcasted in real-time, keeping all teams informed about player affiliations. This continues until all selections are complete, creating an exciting and efficient drafting environment.
